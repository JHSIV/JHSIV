I'm Henry Stadolnik, and I make games, pixel art, and sometimes forays into 3D!

I've been publicly releasing games since 2017, doing both solo and collaborative work.
I focus on programming but have a generalist skillset, handling design, writing, art, and even audio when necessary.
For formal work I'm best versed in Unity and C#, but also have C++ and Unreal Engine experience. 
I also have made a wealth of PICO-8 projects, including FUZ, a demake of Polytron Corporation's FEZ.
