I'm Henry Stadolnik, and I make games, pixel art, and occasional forays into 3D!

I've been publicly releasing games since 2017, doing both solo and collaborative work.
I focus on programming but have a generalist skillset, handling design, writing, art, and even audio when necessary.

For formal work I'm best versed in **Unity** and **C#**, but also have experience with **Unreal Engine**, **C++**, and a number of other languages. 

I have also made a wealth of PICO-8 projects, including *FUZ*, a demake of Polytron Corporation's *FEZ*.
